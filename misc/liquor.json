This wheat \u2013 a most noble and pure grain source \u2013 adds the same richness and flavor to Grey Goose vodka that it brings to the finest French breads and pastries.\r\n\r\nSpring water, originating in the Massif Central Mountains, the heart of France, flows into the Cognac Region.\r\nIt is naturally filtered through champagne limestone resulting in exceptionally sweet and pure water.\r\n\r\nThe pure grain spirit undergoes a five step distillation process.  With each step, the true essence and character of the vodka is revealed.\r\n\r\nFERMENTATION\r\n\r\nOnce the wheat has been ground into a fine flour, it is mixed with water and enzymes, which convert the starch content into fermentable sugars (hydrolysis)\r\n\r\nAt this stage, using a yeast bespoke to Grey Goose, the fermentation process begins.  In order to obtain the same fermented wheat, we closely monitor the temperature of the fermentation throughout the whole process.\r\n\r\nThe temperature is maintained by circulating the product in a loop with cold water\r\n\r\nDISTILLATION\r\nProprietary continuous 5-step distillation process\r\n\r\nFocuses on maximizing and concentrating the flavor of the fine French wheat instead of stripping out impurities because we only use the very best natural ingredients\r\n\r\nThe temperature of each of the five columns is continually adjusted to enable reactions to be triggered at precise temperatures\r\n\r\nThe distillation is constantly monitored by measuring the temperature and pressure in the columns and the quality of the high proof spirit\r\n\r\nPURE SPRING WATER\r\nPure spring water is taken straight from the ground and blended with the spirit\r\n\r\nThe water travels over 400km from the Massif Central to Cognac\r\n\r\nNo need for filtration - naturally filtered through the Grande Champagne limestone\r\n\r\nGives it a softness and natural touch of sweetness\r\n\r\nBLENDING\r\nUnder the supervision of the ma\u00eetre de chai, the high proof spirit is blended with the pure spring water until it reaches the perfect strength and optimal taste\r\n\r\nTHE WORLDS BEST\r\nGrey Goose uses the best at every stage of its production process from the quality of its ingredients to its bottling technology.  From the sourcing of the wheat to the moment a bottle of Grey Goose leaves its home in Cognac, a total of 500 quality control checks are carried out\"","booze_type":"Liquor","url":"","tag":"Grey-Goose-Vodka","editor":"","updated_on":"2009-09-01T06:55:37-04:00","id":181,"phone":"","fax":"","doubled_by":"Lori","checked_by":"Rick","status":"Vegan Friendly","state":"","red_yellow_green":"Green","email":""}},{"company":{"region":"","city":"San Giovanni (MI)","address":"Via Sacchetti, 20 - 20099 Sest","postal":"","created_on":"2009-12-09T06:41:00-05:00","country":"Italy","company_name":"Gruppo Campari","notes":"Company Email: campari@qualitycustomercare.com\r\nNo animal products are used in the production process of Campari.\"\r\nWhen asked what part of the world their answer pertains they wrote: \"Thank you for taking the time to e-mail us.

I received a personal email from an administrative employee who researched the matter.  She thoroughly explained that isinglass was indeed used for clarification of the liquid, and though it was filtered out completely with the impurities from the clarified whiskey, that yes, technically, that meant that it did not fit my definition of vegan.  She did state that that was the only animal-derived product in the process.\"\r\n\r\nAnother email:\r\n\"Thank you for taking the time to e-mail us.

Fermentation is the process whereby yeast converts the wort, which is a sugary solution extracted from the milled cereal grains, into an alcoholic wash( in effect a type of beer). The wash, which contains about 12% alcohol is then triple distilled to give a newly distilled spirit. After maturation of the spirit in oak cask for the minimum number of years this beverage can then be called Whiskey. The production of Jameson Irish Whiskey meets with the strict requirements of the IRISH WHISKEY ACT, 1980, the purpose of which is to define the production and labeling requirements of Irish whiskey and blended Irish whiskey and all other relevant legislation on the production of Irish Whiskey. None of these regulations allow the use of such products.\"\r\n\r\nThe latest update is from Irene:\r\n\"Thank you for taking the time to e-mail us. Jameson is vegan friendly.
