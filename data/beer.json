Called Hopslam Ale, it broadly falls into the category of Imperial IPA (we're not big on style guidelines here). It does, however, contain honey as a source of fermentable sugar. Language to that effect was left off the initial run of labels, but I believe that will be corrected next season. I have already revised my standard reply to questions on whether our beers are vegan, and the presence of honey should be stated on our website as soon as we publish the next revision.\r\n\r\nCompany email 2 via Rick:\r\nAll Bell's products are vegan, with these exceptions:\r\n\r\n(1) Hopslam Ale (contains honey)\r\n(2) Eccentric Ale (contains honey)\r\n(3) No \"specialty brews\" served at their bar should be considered vegan without consulting with the bartender/brewmaster, as others may contain honey.\r\n","booze_type":"Beer","url":"http://www.bellsbeer.com/","tag":"Bells-Brewery","editor":"","updated_on":"2010-04-16T09:06:19-04:00","id":8,"phone":"269-382-2338","fax":"","doubled_by":"Jason, Karen","checked_by":"Anthony","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","state":"MI","red_yellow_green":"Yellow","email":""}},{"company":{"region":"","city":"Old Dalby","address":"Crown Park Station Road","postal":"LE14 3NQ","created_on":"2011-05-12T21:23:00-04:00","country":"UK","company_name":"Belvoir Brewery","notes":"Company Email:\r\n\"Unfortunately we do use isinglass (fish derived) fining in all our beers which may render them unsuitable for you.\r\nThere are one or two brewers who make suitable beers - I am afraid I do not know exactly which breweries.\"","booze_type":"Beer","url":"www.belvoirbrewery.co.uk","tag":"Belvoir-Brewery","editor":"","updated_on":"2011-05-13T21:23:00-04:00","id":1604,"phone":"01664823455","fax":"","doubled_by":"","checked_by":"Bones","status":"Not Vegan Friendly","state":"Leicestershire","red_yellow_green":"Red","email":"colin@belvoirbrewery.co.uk"}},{"company":{"region":"","city":"Brownhills","address":"Forest of Mercia Chasewater Country Park Pool Road","postal":"WS8 7NL","created_on":"2010-05-27T08:03:00-04:00","country":"UK","company_name":"Beowulf Brewing Company","notes":"Company Email: Jan 2011\r\n\"Yes,all our bottled beers are OK for vegans.\r\nWe do those beers in bottles plus :\r\nDark Raven\r\nWuffa\r\nGold Work\r\nFinn's Hall Porter\r\nMercian Shine\r\nIPA\r\n\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"All our Cask Beers have isinglass finings added,and so are unsuitable for vegans.Our Bottled Beers don't,and are vegan-friendly.\"","booze_type":"Beer","url":"http://beowulfbrewery.co.uk/","tag":"Beowulf-Brewing-Company","editor":"","updated_on":"2011-01-27T08:03:00-05:00","id":1079,"phone":"01543 454067","fax":"","doubled_by":"Ian","checked_by":"Andy","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","state":"Staffordshire","red_yellow_green":"Yellow","email":"beowulfbrewing@yahoo.co.uk"}},{"company":{"region":"","city":"South Deerfield","address":"12 Railroad Street","postal":"01373","created_on":"2009-04-22T02:27:00-04:00","country":"USA","company_name":"Berkshire Brewing Company","notes":"Company Email:\r\n\r\n\"We do use isinglass in our products.\"","booze_type":"Beer","url":"http://berkshirebrewingcompany.com","tag":"Berkshire-Brewing-Company","editor":"","updated_on":"2009-04-22T02:28:59-04:00","id":677,"phone":"413-665-6600","fax":"","doubled_by":"","checked_by":"Kevin M","status":"NOT Vegan Friendly","state":"MA","red_yellow_green":"Red","email":"BBC@berkshirebrewingcompany.com"}},{"company":{"region":"","city":"HUMPOLEC","address":"5. kv\u011btna \u010d.1  396 01","postal":"","created_on":"2010-02-04T12:31:00-05:00","country":"Czech Republic","company_name":"Bernard Beer","notes":"Company Email:\r\n\"We don\u00b4t use any animal ingredients.

Personally I would not use isinglass at all as it seems really unnecessary, but we probably wouldn\u2019t be in business\u2026..\"","booze_type":"Beer","url":"www.elmtreebeers.co.uk","tag":"Elmtree","editor":"","updated_on":"2011-05-10T20:28:00-04:00","id":1550,"phone":"01953 887065","fax":"","doubled_by":"","checked_by":"Bones","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","state":"","red_yellow_green":"Yellow","email":"sales@elmtreebeers.co.uk"}},{"company":{"region":"","city":"Seattle","address":"1221 E Pike St.","postal":"98122","created_on":"2010-08-20T18:17:00-04:00","country":"USA","company_name":"Elysian Brewing Company","notes":"Company email:\r\n\r\nOur Perseus Porter and Dragonstooth Stout are vegan.\r\n\r\nWe do however use gelatin as a clarifying agent in our more translucent beer styles, the Wise ESB, The Immortal IPA, the Zephyrus Pilsner and the Avatar Jasmine IPA.\r\n\r\nWe have a collaberation with new belgium in fort collins co, and they use a cetrafuge for clarification, so, anything brewed there would be vegan also.

So here are some answers:\r\n1.  We do not use any animal products in any of our beers.\r\n2.  Our bottled beers available at the LCBO are Hoptical Illusion Almost Pale Ale, Smashbomb Atomic IPA, Netherworld Cascadian Dark Ale, Flying Monkeys Amber Ale, and Antigravity Light Ale.  \r\n3.  Our filters use diatemaceous earth (DE)--a filtration sand comprised of sedimentary rock which may contain the crushed skeletons of prehistoric critters. Is that bad? We do not use isinglass or gelatin.\r\n4.  We also us filtration powder that is DE and a powdery perlite (crushed alumino-silica rock or naturally occuring silicon dioxcide).\r\n5.  Our casks are unfiltered, and unless we call something a honey beer, there is no honey. We made a cask of Smash Jezebel HoneyBomb for C'est What? last spring, but it was just a one-off, specialty experiment which was a sweetened riff on our  Smashbomb Atomic IPA.  That's the only honey we've ever used.  Honestly, we didn't love it.\r\n6. We never use eggs.  \r\n7. We have never brewed a milk stout with lactose --the unfermentable sugar found in milk.  So NO to milk.\r\n8. We brew all our own beer, ourselves,  right here in downtown Barrie. None of our beers are contract brewed or produced off this premises.\r\n9.  We do have some new beers coming down the pipe with turbinado sugar, maple sugar, Madagascar Bourbob Vanilla pods, beers filtered through oak staves . . .  everything I'm thinking of  are all of plant-origins.  Hey, I'm thinking we're vegan!\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, we will soon (by mid 2012) be labelling all allergens in our beers.  Maybe a vegan notification might be useful, too.  If we have to design new labels, why not?\r\n\r\nHope this info was useful, and don't hesitate to ask more questions.  I do not know much about what counts as officially vegan, but I'm developing the idea that our beers are all natural and safe.  We do use varieties of organic hops and nonGMO'd malts.  Not all hop varieties are grown organically, but we try to get them whenever we can.\"\r\n\r\nMore details:\r\n\"None of our LCBO bottled beers have sugar in them.  Barley, hops, water, and yeast.  That's all. We get all our flavours from the varieties of hops and the different types of roast and malted barley or different strains of yeast. \r\n\r\nOf course, that being said, Antigravity has undergone a recipe tweaking recently, so I better check on it.  They're brewing a batch with a different, sweeter  malt, but I don't think anything else was added.  Adjunct or additives are not our style.   And, yes, we do brew a light ale --for slow-pitch softball and lawn mowing -- but the nice hoppy craftier brews you'd find at C'est What? are all vegan approved.  \r\n\r\nOf the beers in the LCBO, Hoptical Illusion Almost Pale Ale, Netherworld Cascadian Dark Ale, and Flying Monkeys Amber Ale are definitely vegan according to your criterion.  Smashbomb Atomic IPA would be vegan, too.  No adjunct or additives in Smashbomb --just buckets and buckets of hops!  You can get that one on tap in a lot of micro-friendly pubs.\r\n\r\nThe casks would be a different story and should be evaluated on a case by case basis.  Any info on Belgian Candi Sugar (yes, \"candi\" spelled with an \"i\"). It's brown and raw-looking, like hardened molassass, and it does have that rich molassass-y flavour.   C'est What? will be getting a 16-18%ABV Imperial Baltic Porter from us called Divinity in the next few weeks, and I know it has Belgian Candi Sugar in it to help get the alcohol content up there.  It tastes like a port --delicious!  The Belgian Candi Sugar is the only wild card for you in that one.  Hope you can drink it, because it is a whole new level in craft beer!\"","booze_type":"Beer","url":"www.theflyingmonkeys.ca","tag":"Flying-Monkeys-Craft-Brewery","editor":"","updated_on":"2011-05-09T17:07:43-04:00","id":1496,"phone":"(705) 721-8989","fax":"","doubled_by":"","checked_by":"AngelA","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","state":"ON","red_yellow_green":"Yellow","email":"andrea@theflyingmonkeys.ca"}},{"company":{"region":"","city":"Winston-Salem","address":"638 West Fourth Street","postal":"","created_on":"2009-05-19T02:49:00-04:00","country":"USA","company_name":"Foothills Brewery","notes":" Company Email:\r\n\r\n\"We do not use any animal byproducts or animal ingredients in our beer.\r\nThey are all completely vegan friendly.\"","booze_type":"Beer","url":"http://foothillsbrewing.com/","tag":"Foothills-Brewery","editor":"","updated_on":"2009-05-19T02:51:30-04:00","id":714,"phone":"336-777-3348","fax":"","doubled_by":"","checked_by":"Kevin M","status":"Vegan Friendly","state":"NC","red_yellow_green":"Green","email":"Sarah@foothillsbrewing.com"}},{"company":{"region":"","city":"Winston-Salem","address":"638 West Fourth St","postal":"27101","created_on":"2011-03-20T17:13:00-04:00","country":"USA","company_name":"Foothills Brewing","notes":"Company Email:\r\n\"No, we do not use any animal products.

We have a 7 bbl brewery here and serve beer on site only (no distributing), although we do fill half-gallon jugs to go. \r\n \r\nThe only ingredients we use here are natural and we don't use honey (although we have considered it).  The ingredients that I have used up to this point are as follows:  barley, hops, yeast, water, Irish moss, and unpasteurized apple cider.\r\n \r\nWe don't filter our beer at all.  We use no isinglass, no gelatin, no bone char, etc.  If you are wondering about Irish moss, it is all natural, made from seaweed.  Irish moss \"is a species of red algae (Chondrus crispus) which grows abundantly along the rocky parts of the Atlantic coast of Europe and North America\". ( from Wikipedia)  We use Irish moss as a kettle coagulant.  Carageenan is the protein found in Irish moss which makes it useful to us brewers.  Carageenan carries a net negative charge on its particle.  Most of the proteins that leach out of the malted barley during the mashing process carry a net positive charge.  Adding Irish moss in the boil (the sweet liquid, wort, is boiled for stability and hop utilization) causes the positively charged proteins to coagulate together around the negatively charged carageenan particles.  This causes protein \"clumps\" to form which then have a much easier time falling to the bottom of the tank.  So, you could call Irish moss an all natural way to help clarify beer.  Every brewer I know uses it to some degree.\r\n \r\nAnyway, we at the Gardner Ale House take pride that our beer is not only all natural, but unfiltered as well, leaving the beer as wholesome and fresh as could possibly be.  Our beer might not always be perfectly clear as a result, but the flavor is unbeatable, and it is nice to know that we can call our beer vegan.  I hope this helps your list.  By the way, right now we have 6 of our own fresh house brews on tap: Facelift IPA, Oma's Altbier, Naked Stout, Snow Slaker Winter Lager, Summer's End Kolsch, and William Tell's Apple Ale.

Nonetheless, I tried to follow a logical thread that has been apparent from the beginning, when Guinness original explained that a certain product (Guinness Extra Stout for export to the U.S.) didn't use Isinglass as a fining agent and was vegan.  How could that be, I asked myself.  Well, I noticed that the Guinness Extra Stout was brewed in Canada.  So, I did some research and found that many of the online commentators at beer sites were wrong. Moosehead, not Labatt's, brewed it for the U.S.  \r\n\r\nThus, I contacted the actual brewers of Guinness Extra Stout that exported here, and their response follows: consumerinquiries@moosehead.ca\r\n\"Hello William,\r\nThank you for your inquiry. We do in fact brew delicious Guinness Extra Stout for export to the States right here in Canada\u2019s most Irish city, Saint John. We do not make use of isinglass in any of our brewing processes, export or domestic. \r\nConsumer Affairs Coordinator\r\nMoosehead Breweries Ltd.\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email: (pamela.daly@diageo.com) March 2011\r\n\"All Guinness brands are free from animal matter. However, isinglass, which is a by-product of the fishing industry is used as a fining agent - i.e. used during processing to clarify beer. There should be little residue in the finished beer. Findings are removed by sedimentation and centrifugation. Therefore it would not be suitable for vegans.\r\nProduction processes in the UK are subject to strict UK/EU legislation and at present isinglass is the only fining agent suitable for stout, which has been approved in the UK. Any new fining agent, especially synthetic substitutes, would not be approved for food without rigorous testing both in Europe and by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. As yet there are no suitable alternatives available.\" \r\n\r\nCompany Email (diageona@consumer-care.net) : January 2011\r\n\"In reference to your inquiry, isinglass, a fish product, is used during the clarification process as a magnet to get rid of excess yeast.

Isinglass  has  been  used  in  beers for centuries as a clarification agent during beer conditioning.  In keg and small pack beers, there  is  very  little,  if any finings left in the finished product as it settles  out  with  the  yeast,  and  any  residues  are removed during the filtration process.\r\n\r\nIn cask beers, however, finings is added to the beer when it is packaged to assist  the  settling  of  the  live yeast that is an integral part of cask conditioning.  Cask beers, then, will always have some finings in the cask, but  if the beer has been treated properly in the pub and isn't cloudy, the sediment  containing  the  majority of finings remains at the bottom of the cask and very little carries through to the finished product.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  fish  finings  work so well that all attempts by brewers to find  a suitable alternative have by and large been unsuccessful. There has been  no  concern over health aspects, as no consumer ill effects have ever been reported over the many, many years that finings have been used.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  conclusion drawn is that there is little, if any, finings in the  finished product, it is advised that as the product may contain traces of finings that we do not say it is suitable for vegetarians.'\r\n\r\nWith  regards  to  our  ciders,  three  of  our products, Strongbow Sirrus, Bulmers Original and Jacques use an animal product as a colouring material.

After a lengthy 3 weeks of aging, most yeast has well settled onto the beechwood at the bottom of the tank and will stay there when the beer moves forward.

We try to treat our yeast as humanely as possible - creating the most favorable conditions we can for good healthy reproduction during primary fermentation. However, once fermentation is complete, it's a different story. Cold temperatures are used to limit the activity of the yeast and encourage it to settle out in order to clear the products. Once clarity has been achieved, the product is racked off into another vessel and the yeast is discarded. Much of this yeast will still be alive, just in a subdued state. The unwanted yeast is introduced to an active composting system where it would die - probably with a couple of days. I'm not really sure if this is cruel or not - it's a very hard one to judge.

Isinglass has been used in beers for centuries as a clarification agent during beer conditioning. In keg and small pack beers, there is very little, if any finings left in the finished product as it settles out with the yeast, and any residues are removed during the filtration process.\r\n\r\nIn cask beers, however, finings is added to the beer when it is packaged to assist the settling of the live yeast that is an integral part of cask conditioning. Cask beers, then, will always have some finings in the cask, but if the beer has been treated properly in the pub and isn't cloudy, the sediment containing the majority of finings remains at the bottom of the cask and very little carries through to the finished product.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, fish finings work so well that all attempts by brewers to find a suitable alternative have by and large been unsuccessful. There has been no concern over health aspects, as no consumer ill effects have ever been reported over the many, many years that finings have been used.\r\n\r\nAlthough the conclusion drawn is that there is little, if any, finings in the finished product, it is advised that as the product may contain traces of finings we do not say it is suitable for vegetarians/vegans.\r\nThank you for your interest in Heineken USA.\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\n\r\nHeineken USA Consumer Affairs\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Although  Scottish  &  Newcastle  UK products are not tested on animals, we treat our beers (this includes Newcastle Brown in can, bottle and keg) with isinglass finings (a solution of collagen prepared from certain fish).\"","booze_type":"Beer","url":"http://www.newcastlebrown.com/","tag":"Newcastle-Brown-Ale","editor":"jason","updated_on":"2011-03-01T14:12:30-05:00","id":43,"phone":"","fax":"","doubled_by":"Kristan, Sharon","checked_by":"Scott Muir","status":"Not Vegan Friendly","state":"","red_yellow_green":"Red","email":"newcastlebrownale@qualitycustomercare.com"}},{"company":{"region":"","city":"St. Catharines","address":"75 St. Paul Street","postal":"L2R 3M3 ","created_on":"2009-03-18T11:47:00-04:00","country":"Canada","company_name":"Niagara's Best Beer","notes":"Company email:\r\n\r\nAs a vegetarian myself, I am keenly aware of ingredients in the food I eat, and I can assure you that both of our beers contain only water, malted barley and/or wheat, hops and yeast.

So you can now start drinking our brand.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (Redstripe@consumer-care.net): Sept 2009\r\n\"In regards to your inquiry, please note that Red Stripe is not vegan.\"\r\n\r\nSept 2008:\r\nThis is one of those cases where international distribution and licensing can lead to different manufacturing processes (or just plain old wrong answers) - when in doubt, double check (and send us the responses!)\r\n\r\nWe're waiting for confirmation from Well & Youngs as Alastair didn't forward the email. \r\nAlastair says:\r\n\"Just to say that Red Stripe is suitable for vegans in the UK, I recently contacted Well & Youngs Brewery and received an email back confirming its suitability for vegans.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\nIn regards to your inquiry, please be advised that at this time, Red Stripe is not Vegan-friendly.

At the brewpub they use gelatin to fine all of the beers for clarification purposes.  This year, they started a production brewery to go along with the brewpub.  They were able to score a nice centrifuge (big machine that spins the beer around to get the yeast out) for this.  At that production facility they make Pliny the Elder (Double IPA), Blind Pig (IPA), and Damnation (Belgian Golden Strong Ale).  They bottle those beers and distribute them all over the country.  However, they also keg those beers (kegged => served on tap) and ship them to a few select markets outside of California.  (Philadelphia being one of them - yay for me!)   There's a good chance most other markets outside of California, Philly, and NYC don't even get draft Russian River stuff.\r\n\r\nSo....\r\n\r\nBlind Pig, Damnation, and Pliny the Elder on draught in bars, or in bottles = good\r\nAnything else (primarily only in bottles - these are barrel aged mostly sour beers) = bad\r\nAnything served in their brewpub in California = bad\r\n\r\nHere's the email I got from Vinnie on Friday:\r\nKevin,\r\nYes, the draft that makes it out to Philly is run through the centrifuge as\r\nwell.\r\nVinnie\"\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  JULY 2009 via Nicole\r\n\"The bottles of Blind Pig IPA Pliny the Elder, and Damnation do not employ gelatin in the production process.

Gutweed (Enteromorpha intestinalis) Hijiki or Hiziki (Sargassum fusiforme) Irish moss (Chondrus crispus) ... an seadible seaweed.\r\n\r\nFor filtration we use: Diatomaceous Earth, explained below:\r\nDiatomaceous earth (pronounced /?da?.?t??me???s ??r?/) also known as diatomite or kieselgur, is a naturally occurring, soft, siliceous sedimentary rock that is easily crumbled into a fine white to off-white powder. It has a particle size ranging from less than 1 micron to more than 1 millimeter, but typically 10 to 200 microns.[1]  This powder has an abrasive feel, similar to pumice powder, and is very light, due to its high porosity. The typical chemical composition of oven dried diatomaceous earth is 80 to 90% silica, with 2 to 4% alumina (attributed mostly to clay minerals) and 0.5 to 2% iron oxide.[1]\r\n\r\nDiatomaceous earth consists of fossilized remains of diatoms, a type of hard-shelled algae. It is used as a filtration aid, as a mild abrasive, as a mechanical insecticide, as an absorbent for liquids, as cat litter, as an activator in blood clotting studies, and as a component of dynamite. As it is also heat-resistant, it can be used as a thermal insulator.\r\n\r\nDiatoms[1]  are a major group of eukaryotic algae, and are one of the most common types of phytoplankton.\r\n\r\nPhytoplankton are the autotrophic  component of the plankton community. The name comes from the Greek words ????? (\"phyton\"), or \"plant\", and ???????? (\"planktos\"), meaning \"wanderer\" or \"drifter\".\r\n\r\nAnd finally, but not last, when we just want to clarify a beer without filtration we use a beer clarifying agent called Biofine Clear A3 also sold by Brewers Supply Group manufactured by Kerry. Biofine Clear A3 is a purified collodial solution of silicic acid (SiO2) in water. It has been specially formulated for the rapid sedimentation of yeast and other haze forming particles in beer.\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email: March 2010\r\n\"Here at the Utah Brewers Co-op we use no products that are animal derived in any of our bottled or draft beers. That includes the Full line of Squatters and Wasatch beers.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: June 2007\r\n\"I can only speak for the beers i produce at my pub regarding their vegan status, because i do not know all the techniques of the other local brewers. My hefewiezen, pilsner, vienna and cask are the only vegan beers we have on tap all the time. I guess if i felt their was a larger demand for a variety of vegan beers i would make more of them. I use finnings to clarify my ales, and as you mentioned, this inhibits them from being vegan. If i do not clarify my beers, the yeast not only makes them cloudy and unpresentable, but it also creates an unpleasant flavor.\r\n\r\nWith that said, you will be happy to know that my assistant is also vegan and has showed great interest in find other ways to clarify our ales with something vegan friendly. I am definitely going to support him in his research efforts. FYI: any filtered beers are vegan.

The only animal product which will find its way into any of our beers is piscine isinglass.\r\n\r\nAs far as cask beers go: While some brewers manage to avoid the use of isinglass by relying on a highly flocculent yeast or by sending beer out with rather low levels of residual yeast, we've found that neither of these approaches will give us beer that reliably conditions in cask and suits normal cellar operations.  Basically, we've found it pretty near impossible to sell pale, cask-conditioned beer unfined, so we do normally use isinglass in these products. On the other hand, our darker beers work well without finings, so we don't put any in, making them suitable for everyone, including vegetarians and vegans.\r\n\r\nThe cask beers of ours I'd suggest would be the \"No. 2 Stout\" or the \"Dark Country\".  And possibly other, occasional beers, which we'd identify on our website as being suitable for vegans.\r\n\r\n Regarding bottled beers: We're planning to start marketing a small range of bottle-conditioned beer and we hope that these will all be  unfined. At present our two filtered, carbonated beers are the \"IPA\" and the \"Dry Stout\".  Of these, the \"Dry Stout\" is unfined, hence suitable for vegans.\r\n \r\nAny utensils or containers that may have been in contact with isinglass will, as a matter of course, be cleaned thoroughly after such use, and before being used for anything else.\r\n\r\nWe're always looking to improve our products, and for me this would include moving away from the use of isinglass where we can.\"","booze_type":"Beer","url":"www.stringersbeer.co.uk","tag":"Stringers-Beer","editor":"","updated_on":"2011-06-14T06:49:00-04:00","id":1705,"phone":"01229581387","fax":"","doubled_by":"","checked_by":"Bones","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","state":"Ulverston","red_yellow_green":"Yellow","email":"jon@stringersbeer.co.uk"}},{"company":{"region":"","city":"","address":"","postal":"","created_on":"2006-08-31T22:58:00-04:00","country":"UK","company_name":"Strongbow - UK","notes":"Company Email:\r\n\"With regards to our ciders, two of our products, Bulmers Original and Jacques use an animal product as a colouring material.

I've got good news and bad news in relation to what I call the \"vegan\" question.\r\n\r\nOur Wheat, Weizen, Maibock, Oktoberfest, Winter Warmer, Saison and upcoming Lambic series are all vegan friendly.\r\n\r\nHowever, in order to clarify our Pale, IPA, Porter and Amber it\r\nnecessitates the use of isinglass because we do not filter our beer.\r\nIsinglass is composed of the swim bladders of a specific type of fish, which helps bond to other proteins and settles out during our conditioning phase. No noticeable flavor changes occur with the use of isinglass, and the actual amount that ends up in the bottle and keg is less than one part per billion. That's the best explanation I can give in defense of our use in relation to these four brews affecting a vegan or vegetarian diet. Honestly, ketchup probably contains a similar amount of unintentional insect parts as part of its finished product.\r\n\r\nOther clarifying agents that can be used involve either silica gels or plastic based media that are not digestible and not something we choose to use on this basis. If we ever move to filtration, isinglass we most likely become a thing of the past, but many arguments exist for unfiltered beer being the most flavorful and colorful traditionally crafted in the market.\r\n\r\nIt's a fun subject for me, and I've had several friendly arguments at festivals and bars when this question comes up.\r\n\r\nI'm always happy to relay that the Wheat, our biggest seller, is vegan.

Of interest is the collagen (protein) in such process aids.  The most common comes from certain fish, and is called isinglass.  For the same clarification purpose some brewers also use gelatin, which is less effective but easier to use than isinglass.  When using isinglass or gelatin, it is likely that only very small amounts of those compounds carryover into the finished beer.\r\nWidmer products do not contain isinglass or gelatin.  We receive quite a few questions on this topic and accordingly try to avoid using gelatin in any of our products, even the experimentals, but one exception is a beer that we produce in small volumes, called KGB Russian Stout, that on occasion contains gelatin.  Additionally, some beers that Widmer brews for charity under the Collaborator brand name contain gelatin.  The Collaborator products are not Widmer products, and are only available in the Portland, Oregon market, and in keg only. \r\nIn addition to the fining agents we have two brands that contain lactose, which is isolated and purified from whey. Depending on one's viewpoint a sugar, like lactose, that is isolated and purified from a dairy product, such as whey, may or may not be considered vegetarian or vegan.  If you are sensitive to this concept you should probably avoid Drop Top Amber and definitely avoid Snow Plow Milk Stout (aka Milk Stout).  DTA contains very little lactose, Snow Plow contains slightly less lactose than milk. One other possible exception is our use of milk sugar in Drop Top Amber ale.  I believe the milk sugar, otherwise known as lactose, is isolated from whey.  Whey comes from milk curds. \r\nA few consumers may consider diatoms animals or animal products so be advised that any filtered Widmer product used diatomaceous earth as the filter media.  Some consumers also consider yeast to be an animal, so be advised that any unfiltered Widmer product will contain live yeast cells, particularly our Hefeweizen.\"","booze_type":"Beer","url":"","tag":"Widmer-Brothers-Brewing","editor":"","updated_on":"2010-03-22T10:48:42-04:00","id":100,"phone":"(503) 281-2437","fax":"(503) 281-1496","doubled_by":"","checked_by":"Andrew","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","state":"OR","red_yellow_green":"Yellow","email":""}},{"company":{"region":"","city":"Calgary","address":"AF23, 4580 Quesnay Wood Drive SW","postal":"T3E 7J3","created_on":"2007-01-16T23:24:00-05:00","country":"Canada","company_name":"Wild Rose Brewery","notes":"Company email:\r\n\"Our beer does not contain any animal ingredients and we use diatomaceous earth for filtration (fossilized algae).\r\n Our WRaspberry Ale has real raspberries and our Alberta Crude Oatmeal Stout has, you guessed it, oatmeal.

Anyways he explained that they used molasses for all but the Thom Jefferson Tavern Ale.  Anyways I was glad to find this out.  I emailed the owner just to make sure, the response is below.\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"We use honey in the Thom Jefferson and we use Molasses in the General Washington and the Spruce.\"\"\r\nCompany Email: Oct 2010\r\n\"We use oyster shells for one of our beers.  We also use Isinglass as a fining agent in the same beer.  It's called Love Stout.  The use of the oyster shells is to extract calcium carbonate which hardens the water and implies a perceived dryness.  \"\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE: JUNE 2009\r\nFrom Kevin: The ales of the revolution series are the ones with honey in them.\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\nHi Justin ~ Thanks for the email and it's not an odd question...we've gotten it before.  We think it is important for people to know about their food and drinks and how it is made.  Surprisingly enough, we are forbidden - by law- to put any kind of ingredient or nutritional label on our beers.  Breweries aren't governed by the FDA. The macro breweries lobbied the Federal Government very strongly in favor of not putting ingredient/nutritional labels on beer.  Crazy but true.  I guess they don't want people to know about all the chemicals, etc. that they put in their beers.  So, the answer to your question is - no, we do not use any animal products or byproducts in our beers. The filters we use are diametaceous earth so it contains nothing animal related.\r\n","booze_type":"Beer","url":"http://www.yardsbrewing.com","tag":"Yards-Brewing","editor":"roryreiff","updated_on":"2010-02-19T10:36:00-05:00","id":139,"phone":"215-634-2600","fax":"","doubled_by":"Dennis, Kevin (twice!), Eric","checked_by":"Justin","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","state":"PA","red_yellow_green":"Yellow","email":"info@yardsbrewing.com"}},{"company":{"region":"","city":"Nashville ","address":"1200 Clinton St # 110","postal":"","created_on":"2009-04-18T01:11:00-04:00","country":"USA","company_name":"Yazoo Brewing Company","notes":"Company Email:\r\n\r\n\"To my knowledge we don't use any animal based products.
