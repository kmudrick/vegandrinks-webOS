It was just a few weeks ago that I got accosted at the farmers market by a few folks who couldn't believe that we would even consider making a wine that wasn't vegan.  It was very disheartening since we are trying very hard to move as many of our products towards sustainable and organic farming practices as possible.  We've even got to the point where all but one of the wines we completely make ourselves are from organic grapes.  So, your note was quite refreshing.  I am in the process of going back and looking through all our winemaking notes.  I'm not sure how familiar you are with our wines, but we have four labels:  Stumbling Block, Shy Chenin, Reversal, and Basket Case.  The Basket Case brand is a combination of wine that we produce ourselves as well as wine we have contract made for us by other wineries.  Though we are pretty involved in that wine making as well, I'm not comfortable telling you that they are Vegan-chances are they are not.  <b> As for the other three labels-Shy Chenin, Stumbling Block, and Reversal, we make all those wines and I am 90% sure they are Vegan.  I am only hesitating until I get all of the records for all of the lots in front of me at one time.  As a general rule, we try very hard not to add animal products, not because we are necessarily against it (although there is so much interest we are planning on making our wines 'Vegan' just because we can) but because our style of winemaking is to be as minimal as possible.  To my knowledge we have not done any fining with animal products, but let me get back to you on that. </b> Just out of curiosity, what do you as a vegan think of PVPP?  It's basically a plastic that is used sort of like a fining agent.  I would think it would be considered Vegan, but I'm not that big a fan of sticking micro-petroleum particles into my wine.

After checking with our winemaking team, I have learned that on a very limited number of our red wines we might add casein (from milk) and albumen (egg whites). Both of these are proteins and are used as fining agents to remove tannins and reduce astringency. These are removed as precipitates and it is doubtful any traces of these proteins remain after the fining operation. It depends from year to year which red wines may be put through this process, so I can't tell you specifically which wines might be affected. On the other hand, our white and blush wines, such as Chardonnay and White Zinfandel are not fined at all. They may go through a filtering agent such as cellulose pads or diatomaceous earth. In membrane filtration the wine is passed through a thin film of plastic polymer material having uniformly sized holes. In both cases nothing is added to the wine.\r\n\r\nAh, sounds semi-good, but then we get company email 2:\r\n\r\nThank you for contacting Beringer.  We do not recommend any of our wine for vegans due to the possibility that the wine has been clarified with fining agents such as egg albumin, casein, gelatin and isinglass. The winemakers decide on which fining agents are used and these may vary from product to product and even batch to batch (usually depending on the grapes of that particular year). It is important to note that despite fining agents being used during the winemaking process, they are removed prior to bottling.

Part of the beauty of wine is that it is alive and vibrant. With international safety standards, consumer health considerations and also wine presentation, however, wine needs to be stabilized from a microbiological standpoint. Lees and excess tannins need to be removed from wine to make it fit for sale, which involves a process called fining, or clarification.\r\n\r\nIn order to minimize loss of colour and flavour, and also ensure no off-flavours are added to the wine, at Concha y Toro we use the most wine-friendly fining agents possible.  Depending of the state of the must, in the case of white wines, and the young wine, in the case of reds, we use the minimum amount of animal derived proteins or minerals possible for fining. Prior to bottling, all flocculated protein residues are filtered off. In other words, while animal proteins may be employed, the final wine is effectively protein free. Therefore, at the end of the day it is a matter it is matter of consumer choice. Concha y Toro will use viable non-animal derived fining agents where possible. \"","booze_type":"Wine","url":"http://www.casillerodeldiablo.com/","tag":"Casillero-del-Diablo","editor":"","updated_on":"2010-04-22T11:24:00-04:00","id":1053,"phone":"","fax":"","doubled_by":"","checked_by":"Johan","status":"Not Vegan Friendly","state":"","red_yellow_green":"Red","email":"contact@casillerodeldiablo.com"}},{"company":{"region":"Australia","city":"The Summit","address":"PO Box 13, Amiens Rd","postal":"4377","created_on":"2010-08-22T20:32:00-04:00","country":"Australia","company_name":"Castle Glen Australia","notes":"Company Email:\r\n\"All of our products are vegan friendly.

Indeed, gelatine appears to be one of the clarifiers with greater agglutinating capabilities, and more selective power in the fining of wine. \r\nIn addition to that, gelatine is used in very low doses (average dose is 1 gr. per 100 liters of  must). We are talking about one gram of a transformed, purified, and sanitarily harmless product. On top of that, gelatine is eliminated from the wine by filtration, after agglutinating with the existing colloidal materials in the wine. \r\nAnother advantage of gelatine is that it offers high productivity during the filtration due to its agglutinating power. Otherwise, a couple of things could happen:\r\n\u2022\twine filtration cycles would be considerably shorter, increasing at the same time the filtration costs.\r\n\u2022\tit considerably would increase the volume of filtering earth needed with the inevitable environmental damages that this represents. \r\nFor the production of our Cava, we use both our own base wines and wines selected from other wineries. Some of these wineries have implemented modern methods to separate the lees (Mosto fining) based on modern flotation systems. One of the advantages of these systems is the elimination of filtering earths and, therefore, reducing the environmental impact. One of the key elements in this system is the use of the gelatine. \r\n<B>It is for these reasons that we sincerely believe that using small amounts of gelatine in the transformation process of wine, should not have any effect on consumption by vegetarians.\r\nIn conclusion, if we were not allowed to use gelatine, we would have to carry out a rigorous study on the consequences over our products and facilities. This would involve an important work of advising and control over our suppliers, which some of whom have adapted their systems to the separation of lees process described previously.</B>\r\n\r\nUPDATE\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"Our wines are not suitable for vegans since we use a clarifying agent that has egg whites. \"\r\n\r\nCompany Email:\r\n\"Our wines are not suitable for vegans since we use a clarifying agent that has egg whites.\"\r\n\r\n","booze_type":"Wine","url":"http://www.freixenet.com/","tag":"Freixenet-Sparkling-Wines","editor":"","updated_on":"2010-01-02T06:43:03-05:00","id":575,"phone":"+34 938 917 000","fax":"","doubled_by":"Cassie","checked_by":"Ingrid","status":"NOT Vegan Friendly","state":"Barcelona","red_yellow_green":"Red","email":"freixenet@freixenet.es"}},{"company":{"region":"France","city":"Sausalito","address":"2320 Marinship Way, Suite 140","postal":"94965","created_on":"2008-02-21T22:16:00-05:00","country":"USA","company_name":"French Rabbit","notes":"Company email:\r\n\"French rabbit wines (all varieties) are vegan-friendly.

There are a few selected wines that we fine with refined protein made from animal based products.  The fining agents are mixed with the wine to remove specific compounds.

The final product is then filtered through a 0.22 micron membrane that removes all particles, bacteria or microorganisms.\r\n \r\nBecause wine is a natural based product whose characteristics vary from vintage to vintage, we treat each wine and each vintage differently.  The fining agents that we use may be used in some wines for some vintages and then not used for the same wine the following year.  Due to the possibility of blending of very small amounts from vintage to vintage (5% or less is allowable by law), we cannot assure with 100% certainty that any wine has been produced without using any animal based products.","booze_type":"Wine","url":"http://www.jlohr.com/","tag":"J-Lohr-Winery","editor":"","updated_on":"2009-12-09T14:41:45-05:00","id":579,"phone":"408-288-5057","fax":"408-993-2276","doubled_by":"","checked_by":"Steven R","status":"NOT Vegan Friendly","state":"CA","red_yellow_green":"Red","email":"barkley@jlohr.com"}},{"company":{"region":"Canada","city":"Niagara-on-the-Lake","address":"2145 Regional Road 55","postal":"L0S 1J0","created_on":"2008-07-04T00:45:00-04:00","country":"Canada","company_name":"Jackson Triggs Winery","notes":"Company Email:\r\n\"From the receiving of the grapes all what we add on the product is: Tannins (they are extracted by the juice from the Oak) \u2013 natural Enzymes present on the skins of the grapes as well as yeasts for the fermentation.\r\nAs the juice is done fermenting we add some sulfur to protect by oxidations.\r\nThe wines age in tank or barrels with no further additions.\r\nJust before bottling White wines are added with Bentonite (it\u2019s a mineral from the \u201cclay\u201d family) to remove some proteins for stability \u2013 we don\u2019t add this adjuvat to red wines as they do not have (generally speaking) this kind of instability.\r\nThe filter we use to clean up the wines is called CrossFlow Filter and uses Nitrile/Vinyl based polymers as physical screen for it\u2019s cut-off.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\nThank you for your inquiry.

I don't know if you are referring to our Chardonnay or our Cabernet so I will attempt to answer both.\r\n\r\nChardonnay:  we use a combination of bentonite (earth based ) which is a montmorillonite clay that is used to drop out any protein that may cause a haze in our white wine.  For the juice, prior to fermentation, a combination of both bentonite and casein (a milk derived protein) is used which softens the astringent nature of our wine by minimizing the effect of the skins from the grape pressing.  The sediment (lees) from the deposition of the fining agent and the proteins, phenolics from the juice are racked (drawn) off and sent out for disposal (actually another winery uses the settlings). Of course our Chardonnay is filtered prior to bottling.\r\n\r\nCabernet:  the only fining agents we use are protein/animal based: gelatin and egg white.  The gelatin is used in very small quantities and helps remove amorphous material as well as microbial (yeasts and malolactic bacteria) that cloud the wine.  Fresh egg whites (not the yolk) is added as a way of balancing out the oak tannins and the fruit derived tannins.  It is a very common procedure used throughout the world; but some winemakers elect not to use egg whites as they fear it will remove flavor components.  We use egg whites because we feel the flavor components are enhanced.  I don't know if it is possible for residual egg whites to be present in our wine.  We filter our wine prior to bottling and after fining (0.65 microns absolute- which means nothing passes through the filter larger than 0.65 microns.  This is to eliminate any residual yeast and most malolactic bacteria) so I would imagine that the bound egg white with the tannin complex is removed.","booze_type":"Wine","url":"http://jordanwinery.com/","tag":"Jordan-Winery","editor":"","updated_on":"2009-12-09T14:33:15-05:00","id":541,"phone":"800-654-1213","fax":"","doubled_by":"","checked_by":"Megan","status":"Not vegan friendly","state":"CA","red_yellow_green":"Red","email":"info@jordanwinery.com"}},{"company":{"region":"Canada","city":"Niagara-on-the-Lake","address":"1811 Niagara Stone Road (Hwy 55) RR 2","postal":"L0S 1J0","created_on":"2007-10-26T11:43:00-04:00","country":"Canada","company_name":"Joseph's Estate Wines Inc.","notes":"Company email:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, our wines are vegan-friendly.

Well, we had to add some sugar in 2007.\r\n\r\nBackground on animals and wine: basically, animal products are added because the winemaker is trying to use protein to make other chemicals such as tannins fall out of solution.  This is almost exclusive to red wines.  When we fine white wines, we are trying to remove protein, so we are adding things such as bentonite clay.\r\n\r\nThe hotter the climate the grapes are grown, the more pressure there is to use fining agents on red wine.  Hot climates increase the skin to weight ratio at harvest, meaning the grapes have more tannin in them.\r\n\r\nWe don't fine our red wines: meaning no ox blood, isinglass, milk protein, egg whites, etc.  We have found that patience and time in the barrel address the needs.

Fining can eliminate bitterness, astringency, brown color, cloudiness, and other things best left out of wine. After the fining agent is added to wine, it clings physically or electrostatically to whatever protein or other targeted substance in the wine, and gravity generally brings it to the bottom of the storage vessel. The wine can then be drawn off the sediment, and may or may not be subjected to filtration. Some fining agents are \"earth\" based, and some are \"animal\" based. While theoretically no fining agent will end up in the final wine, strict adherents to some versions of vegetarianism would prefer not to make use of any product if animal derived substances were used during processing.\r\nFining is never done formulaically. Rather, if a wine might be subject to some improvement in, let's say astringency, then a representative sample of the wine is trialed under laboratory conditions with a variety of fining agents in varying amounts that are known to reduce astringency. The four best fining agents to reduce astringency are all animal based: egg whites, gelatin, isinglass (from fish), and casein (from milk). Other commonly used fining agents include bentonite (a clay), Sparkolloid (from algae), and activated carbon. Keep in mind that fining is an optional tool, and if a wine is delicious as it is, it may not require fining at all.\r\nSo what's a vegan to do?\r\nGenerally, red wines are more likely (but not necessarily) to have been fined for astringency with an animal based product than white wines. Some red wines are bottled as \"unfined\" and these are really the only prudent choice for a strict vegan. White wines, too, are sometimes fined with casein or isinglass, so it is always recommended that vegans contact a winery directly to learn what wines are best suited to them.\r\nOf the current releases of Rodney Strong Vineyards wines, vegans should be comfortable enjoying our 2007 Charlotte's Home Sauvignon Blanc, and our 2007 Sonoma County Chardonnay, both of which were finished only with \"earth\" based fining.\"","booze_type":"Wine","url":"http://www.rodneystrong.com","tag":"Rodney-Strong-Vineyards","editor":"","updated_on":"2009-12-09T10:33:05-05:00","id":769,"phone":"866-779-4637","fax":"","doubled_by":"","checked_by":"AngelA","status":"Some Vegan Friendly Options","state":"CA","red_yellow_green":"Yellow","email":"collectorscircle@rodneystrong.com"}},{"company":{"region":"Canada","city":"Kelowna","address":"2306 Hayman Road","postal":"V1Z 1Z5","created_on":"2009-04-16T06:13:00-04:00","country":"Canada","company_name":"Rollingdale Wines","notes":"Company Email:\r\n\r\n\"-Red wine we make our premiums with the free run fraction, which doesn't have the harsh tannin of the press fraction.  Our premium free run reds are bottled unfined, unfiltered, making all of our top reds Vegan Friendly. However the press red, in our case (Tumbleweed Red) is fined with egg white to strip tannins.That is our only fined red.  Other fining agents strip the colour from red.\r\n\r\n-  White wines I usually just use bentonite, but again our premiums are generally free run, or very lightly pressed to avoid astringency, and the bentonite is sufficient to achieve protein stability when properly used.  The press white has more astringency from seeds, skins, and stems, and may require gelatin which is a very strong fining agent.  Improperly used it can easily strip a wine bare, and is rarely used in my cellar.  The single wine of ours that I have used gelatin on is the, as of yet unreleased, Tumbleweed White NV (accumlated years of press fractions).  On our 2006 Luminescence Chardonnay, we used some Isinglass in fining as a bit of an experiment, but I found that I much prefer to use bentonite for the compact lees and faster settling.  \r\n\r\nOur 2007 Luminescence is the only Certified Organic Chardonnay in BC at the moment, definitely Vegan Friendly!

You are correct in saying that many wineries use fining products in their wines but I think that it is much less than in the past.  I remember when I first started winemaking in the early 90\u2019s I used several of these products.  But now because of educational advances in grape growing and winemaking many of these products are unnecessary.  For example, in red wines these products were used to mellow out harsh tannins after the fermentation.  Because the vineyard canopies have been opened up to allow more sunlight onto the fruit these tannins are not as hard.  Also in the winery there is more attention to pump-over management and temperature of fermentation which reduces the extraction of these harsh tannins.  So, to answer your question here at St Francis we do not use any animal based products in our wines.\"\r\n\r\n...And later we got some clarification (no pub intended):\r\n\r\n\"Vegan friendly\"? Meaning do we like vegans? Of course!\r\n\r\nIf you are asking if our wines are vegan, I would say yes to all except the zinfandels, which SOMETIMES receive dosing of an egg-white product. The purpose is it eliminates certain killer yeast that can hinder fermentations. We've only used it on zins since they come in so ripe. That substance is immediately dropped to the bottom, and by the time the wine is bottled it has been through a couple rackings + sterile filtering so there would be no remnants whatsoever of the egg whites. But, to be truthful I would say no to the zins.\"","booze_type":"Wine","url":"http://www.stfranciswinery.com/","tag":"St-Francis-Winery","editor":"","updated_on":"2010-07-06T20:53:41-04:00","id":863,"phone":"707-833-2148","fax":"","doubled_by":"Anne","checked_by":"Catherine","status":"Non-Zinfandels Vegan Friendly","state":"CA","red_yellow_green":"Yellow","email":"HMunden@stfranciswinery.com"}},{"company":{"region":"United States","city":"St James","address":"540 Sidney Street","postal":"65559","created_on":"2010-07-06T20:24:00-04:00","country":"USA","company_name":"St James Winery","notes":"Company email:\r\n\r\n\"The fruit wines are fine.

It's an interesting one.   The short answer - no we don't use animal products in making our wine.  The gentle way we grow, pick, and ferment our grapes leads to naturally balanced tannin levels, so we don't need to add animal proteins to achieve correct tannin levels.\r\n\r\nNow for the long answer:\r\nIt's true that animal proteins are frequently used in winemaking. Their function is usually to control the levels of tannins in the wine.  Tannins are complex molecules that react with proteins.  They are naturally produced by many types of plants as a natural defensive compound against pests and stressful conditions.  In wine, overripe or stressed grapes can produce large quantities of tannins while still on the vine, and these tannin levels can be exacerbated by rough handling of the grapes during fermentation in the winery. \r\n\r\nWhen tannins react with the proteins in your mouth, they produce a drying, gritty sensation.  In subtle quantities, tannins create a velvety texture to the wine;  in greater quantities the sensation is decidedly unpleasant.  That's why some winemakers regularly fine their wines to remove excess tannins.  The tannins react with the proteins in the fining agent and precipitate them to the bottom of the barrel, making the wines taste softer and more palatable.\r\n\r\nHowever, at The Eyrie Vineyards we moderate tannins naturally.  We carefully manage the amount of sunlight that falls on the fruit, keeping stress to a minimum while boosting ripeness.  Our organic spray program keeps the grapes free of mildews and molds that lead the plants to create defensive tannins.  Our deep rooted vines tap into perennial sources of water.  As a result, drought stress is minimized and so are tannins.  \r\n\r\nThe grapes are picked by hand, destemmed whole berry, pressed in old fashioned platen style presses, and aged in neutral oak barrels.    These gentle winemaking techniques preserve the fruit flavors and give us naturally balanced wines that require little intervention on the part of the winemaker.\r\n\r\n","booze_type":"Wine","url":"http://www.eyrievineyards.com/","tag":"The-Eyrie-Vineyards-BlackCap","editor":"","updated_on":"2009-12-09T10:39:40-05:00","id":117,"phone":"888.440.4970","fax":"503.472.5124","doubled_by":"","checked_by":"Brendon","status":"Vegan Friendly","state":"OR","red_yellow_green":"Green","email":"jason@eyrievineyards.com"}},{"company":{"region":"Canada","city":"Hillier","address":"990 Closson Road","postal":"K0K2J0","created_on":"2008-08-13T00:30:00-04:00","country":"Canada","company_name":"The Grange of Prince Edward","notes":"Dave says:\r\n\r\n\"Operations Manager Mike Pettleson confirmed that the winery uses only bentonite for fining; all Grange products are vegan.\"","booze_type":"Wine","url":"http://www.grangeofprinceedward.com","tag":"The-Grange-of-Prince-Edward","editor":"","updated_on":"2009-12-09T14:25:51-05:00","id":454,"phone":"613.399.1048","fax":"","doubled_by":"","checked_by":"Dave","status":"Vegan Friendly","state":"ON","red_yellow_green":"Green","email":"info@grangeofprinceedward.com"}},{"company":{"region":"United States","city":"Napa","address":"600 Airpark Road","postal":"94558","created_on":"2007-09-06T18:53:00-04:00","country":"USA","company_name":"The Little Penguin","notes":"Company Email: July 2010\r\n\"We do not recommend any of our wine for vegans due to the possibility that the wine has been clarified with fining agents such as egg albumin, casein, gelatin and isinglass.

The answer, unfortunately, is not too clear. Our wine makers use various fining agents during the wine making process. Some of these products are suitable for vegans, however sometimes in order to get the wine just right, they add products such as gelatin, which I know is not something that is appropriate for vegans. The hard part is that it depends on how the wine making is going and how the particular \"recipe batch\" is going. The wine makers then decide which fining agents should be added to achieve the desired end result.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry we don't have a more specific answer but unfortunately, it does vary from vintage to vintage.

Your question brings up a very interesting issue.\r\n\r\nFor centuries, winemakers have used traditional, natural techniques to fine and filter their wines.  Some of these techniques involve animal byproducts including, for example, egg whites, which may be used and then removed in certain steps of the winemaking process.  This may seem odd to those unfamiliar with the centuries-old art of winemaking, however these practices are widely used to this day and often result in levels well below human detection - the scale of which is measured by single parts per million gallons or liters.\r\n\r\nWhile most would consider this level insignificant, we take the concerns of our vegan friends very seriously and in good conscience, do not claim our wines to be 100% vegan.

The only reference I can find in\r\nregards to animal products in wine production is the very old rustic Italian\r\npractise of including a pound of horseflesh in a barrel of wine, to 'make it\r\nstronger'. That sounds really disgusting, and horses are for petting, not\r\neating.\r\n\r\nOur fining agents are derived from animals. Isinglass is a colloidal protein\r\nmade from the swim bladders of Cichlid fish, dried, processed and dissolved\r\nin a liquid. As a side-note, the bladders are a by-product of a food fishery\r\nin Africa and the entire enterprise is completely sustainable.\r\n\r\nThe Chitosan is a long-chain sucrose polymer made from the shells of\r\ncrustaceans like prawns, crabs, lobsters and shrimp. Again, it is a\r\nby-product of a food fishery.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is simple to replace these products with Agar gelatine, derived\r\nfrom seaweed and easily available from health food stores. Dosage rates are\r\nproblematic, but I would start with two teaspoons of gelatine powder\r\ndissolved in a cup of water to start.\r\n\r\nThese product facts aside, it's important to note that many non-animal\r\nderived foods and beverages have significant sources of animal-derived\r\nproducts in them, as a consequence of where they are grown and harvested. To\r\nquote California winemaker and researcher Lum Eisenman,\r\n\r\n\"On average, one ton of California wine grapes contains seven pounds of\r\ndirt, one mouse nest, 147 bees, 98 wasps, 1,014 earwigs, 1,833 ants, 10,899\r\nleafhoppers and three pounds of bird droppings. In addition, the waxy\r\ncoating on grape skins contains many microorganisms. Grapes are crushed\r\nwithout washing, so crushed grapes contain several non-grape substances and\r\nmany microorganisms. Consequently, attempting to sterilize crush equipment\r\nseems a bit futile. The nitrogen (bird droppings) and protein materials\r\n(bugs) are consumed during fermentation by the yeast. When fermentation is\r\ncomplete, the dirt, bees wings, earwig tails, etc. settle to the bottom of\r\nthe fermenters, and much of the yeast and ugly stuff is left behind when\r\nwine is racked.\"","booze_type":"Wine","url":"http://www.winexpert.com/","tag":"Winexpert-Home-Wine-Kit","editor":"","updated_on":"2011-03-20T17:26:00-04:00","id":1334,"phone":"1-800-339-2266","fax":"","doubled_by":"","checked_by":"Shelley","status":"Not Vegan Friendly","state":"BC","red_yellow_green":"Red","email":"tim.vandergrift@winexpert.com"}},{"company":{"region":"United States","city":"Winterport","address":"South Main Street","postal":"04496","created_on":"2010-05-27T08:07:00-04:00","country":"USA","company_name":"Winterport Winery","notes":"Company Email when asked Official Barnivore question:\r\n\"We do not add any of the things you mentioned to our wines and we determined that we have vegan-friendly wines and ales\r\naccording to that criteria. \"","booze_type":"Wine","url":"http://winterportwinery.com/","tag":"Winterport-Winery","editor":"","updated_on":"2010-05-27T08:07:00-04:00","id":1080,"phone":"207-223-4500","fax":"","doubled_by":"","checked_by":"Christina","status":"Vegan Friendly","state":"ME","red_yellow_green":"Green","email":"info@winterportwinery.com"}},{"company":{"region":"New Zealand","city":"Blenheim","address":"211 New Renwick Road, RD2","postal":"","created_on":"2007-06-25T23:53:00-04:00","country":"New Zealand","company_name":"Wither Hills","notes":"Company email:\r\nWell you are in luck, with the Wither Hills Sauvignon Blanc.

In using these agents the winemaker is further fine-tuning the structure of the wine. The use of small amounts of fining agents is generally necessary to ensure that the wine will be clear, stable and sound, have longevity and be enjoyable to taste.\r\n\r\nThe winemakers decide on which fining agents are used and these may vary from product to product and even batch to batch (usually depending on the grapes of that particular year). It is important to note that despite fining agents being used during the winemaking process, they are removed prior to bottling.\"","booze_type":"Wine","url":"http://yellowglen.com","tag":"Yellowglen","editor":"","updated_on":"2011-05-09T16:01:00-04:00","id":1526,"phone":"1300 651 650","fax":"","doubled_by":"","checked_by":"Kristin","status":"Not Vegan Friendly","state":"","red_yellow_green":"Red","email":"http://yellowglen.com/contact-us/"}},{"company":{"region":"United States","city":"Los Olivos","address":"6905 Foxen Canyon Road.
